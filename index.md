title: The Problem - Lawncare Is Harmful

## How Lawncare Causes Harm

Lawncare is expensive, resource intensive, and, counterintuitively, harmful to our building's landscape and environment. This [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/25/opinion/leaf-blowers-california-emissions.html) lays out some of the harms in detail:

> Nearly everything about how Americans “care” for their lawns is deadly. Pesticides prevent wildflower seeds from germinating and poison the insects that feed songbirds and other wildlife. Lawn mower blades, set too low, chop into bits the snakes and turtles and baby rabbits that can’t get away in time. Mulch, piled too deep, smothers ground-nesting bees, and often the very plants that mulch is supposed to protect, as well.

## Water Usage

> A small, 1,000-square-foot lawn could require as much as [20,000 gallons](https://libguides.nybg.org/downsizinglawns) of water per year to be green. It is estimated that more than 50% of residential and commercial irrigation water use goes to waste due to evaporation, wind, over watering and poor system design.

## Air Pollution

A [2011 study](https://www.edmunds.com/about/press/leaf-blowers-emissions-dirtier-than-high-performance-pick-up-trucks-says-edmunds-insidelinecom.html) by Edmunds found that a two-stroke gasoline-powered leaf blower released more pollution than a 6,200-pound Ford F-150 SVT Raptor pickup 
truck. Jason Kavanagh, the engineering editor at Edmunds at the time, noted that “hydrocarbon emissions from a half-hour of yard work with the two-stroke 
leaf blower are about the same as a 3,900-mile drive from Texas to Alaska in a Raptor.” While car and truck emissions have been regulated and improved with 
pollution-removing equipment, garden equipment engine emissions have been unregulated since the 1990s.

## Noise Pollution

Not only is the practice of using leaf blowers harmful and unnecessary, it's also loud. The noise from our landscaper's exceeds 80 decibels as measured from my apartment. According to the [NYC Noise Code](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dep/downloads/pdf/environment/education/nyc-noise-code-fact-sheet.pdf), "music from commercial venues must not exceed 42 decibels as measured within a nearby residence". "Garbage trucks must not exceed 80 decibels when measured 35 feet from a residence".


# The Solution - Do Less

## Replace Grass With Low-Maintenance Ground Cover

There are many low-maintenance grass replacement options.The New York Botanical Garden wrote this article about [replacing lawns](https://libguides.nybg.org/downsizinglawns) with plants native to our region. Below is a list of some of their suggestions. This [New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/15/realestate/yes-you-can-do-better-than-the-great-american-lawn.html) also has some great native plant suggestions.

## Stop Removing Leaves

[City law states](https://portal.311.nyc.gov/article/?kanumber=KA-01803) that property owners must clear the sidewalk and 18" into the street of debris, which is genrally defined as:

- loose trash
- stray garbage bags
- broken glass
- snow and ice

The definition of debris does not include leaves, suggesting that removing them is voluntary. According to [New York City Law School](https://www.citylandnyc.org/autumn-has-arrived-how-do-you-get-rid-of-that-pile-of-leaves/):

> Under New York City’s Administrative Code, leaves are defined as “yard waste” or “organics waste” and includes: leaves, grass clippings, garden debris, vegetative residue (parts of a plant or vegetable), small or chipped branches, and similar material. *Clearing fall leaves in New York City is voluntary and residents do not receive summonses from the Department of Sanitation for fallen leaves on sidewalks.*

Leaves are also beneficial to grass and flower beds. Removing them robs our building landscapes soil of nitrogen, causing us to have to pay for more fertilizer.
> ...research has shown that lawns actually benefit from a thin layer of leaves, and the rest can be piled up around ornamental trees, shrubs, and perennials to no ill effect.

> ...you can create planting beds from fallen leaves as a source of soil-building organic matter.

Removing leaves is also pointless, because trees don't stop dropping leaves after a sidewalk has been cleared. Below is a photo of a sidewalk two hours after a 30-plus minute leafblowing session.

It would also benefit us to stop using gas-powered lawn equipment now, because New York State Law may soon prohibit its use entirely. There is currently [a proposed bill](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2021/S7462) in the New York State Senate that would require all lawncare equipment to be zero-emission by 2027. Similar laws have already passed in White Plains and Long Island.

# Action Items
- Replace our grass with low-maintenance alternative that needs little or no mowing. This will help reduce the need for gas-powered lawn equipment.
- Do not clear sidewalks with gas-powered leaf blowers. Use electric equipment, or better, allow the wind to distribute leaves and grass naturally. This lawn refuse is natural fertilizer, and there is no need to remove it. This applies to our building staff and our landscape contractors.
- Work with our landscaper to better understand our building's needs and develop healthier maintenance practices, with the goal of eliminating the use of gas-powered lawn equipment, which is likely to be banned by the state in the near future. Specific items may include:
  - Use hand clippers instead of electric trimmers
  - Stop mowing ground cover once grass replacement is established
  - Use a broom to clear sidewalks, or do not clear them at all. It will not be necessary if we are no longer mowing.
