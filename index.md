## Lawn equipment pollution

>  A 2011 study by Edmunds found that a two-stroke gasoline-powered leaf blower released more pollution than a 6,200-pound Ford F-150 SVT Raptor pickup 
truck. Jason Kavanagh, the engineering editor at Edmunds at the time, noted that “hydrocarbon emissions from a half-hour of yard work with the two-stroke 
leaf blower are about the same as a 3,900-mile drive from Texas to Alaska in a Raptor.” While car and truck emissions have been regulated and improved with 
pollution-removing equipment, garden equipment engine emissions have been unregulated since the 1990s.

## Zero emission lawncare

There is currently [a proposed bill](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2021/S7462) in the New York State Senate that would require all lawncare equipment to be zero-emission by 2027. Similar laws have already passed in White Plains and Long Island.

## Leave the Leaves

There is no need to remove fallen leaves from our building's landscaped areas. 

> ...research has shown that lawns actually benefit from a thin layer of leaves, and the rest can be piled up around ornamental trees, shrubs, and perennials to no ill effect.

> ...you can create planting beds from fallen leaves as a source of soil-building organic matter.

City law states that property owners must clear the sidewalk and 18" into the street of debris, which is genrally defined as:

According to [New York City Law School](https://www.citylandnyc.org/autumn-has-arrived-how-do-you-get-rid-of-that-pile-of-leaves/):

> Under New York City’s Administrative Code, leaves are defined as “yard waste” or “organics waste” and includes: leaves, grass clippings, garden debris, vegetative residue (parts of a plant or vegetable), small or chipped branches, and similar material. *Clearing fall leaves in New York City is voluntary and residents do not receive summonses from the Department of Sanitation for fallen leaves on sidewalks.*

## Lawn Replacement 

### Lawncare is harmful

> Nearly everything about how Americans “care” for their lawns is deadly. Pesticides prevent wildflower seeds from germinating and poison the insects that feed songbirds and other wildlife. Lawn mower blades, set too low, chop into bits the snakes and turtles and baby rabbits that can’t get away in time. Mulch, piled too deep, smothers ground-nesting bees, and often the very plants that mulch is supposed to protect, as well.

### Lawncare uses lots of water:

> A small, 1,000-square-foot lawn could require as much as 20,000 gallons of water per year to be green. It is estimated that more than 50% of residential and commercial irrigation water use goes to waste due to evaporation, wind, over watering and poor system design.

### Replacement options
Tickseed, a grass replacement option.
