Absurd pollution:
  A 2011 study by Edmunds found that a two-stroke gasoline-powered leaf blower released more pollution than a 6,200-pound Ford F-150 SVT Raptor pickup 
truck. Jason Kavanagh, the engineering editor at Edmunds at the time, noted that “hydrocarbon emissions from a half-hour of yard work with the two-stroke 
leaf blower are about the same as a 3,900-mile drive from Texas to Alaska in a Raptor.” While car and truck emissions have been regulated and improved with 
pollution-removing equipment, garden equipment engine emissions have been unregulated since the 1990s.
